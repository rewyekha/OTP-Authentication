# OTP_Application
- An application that will send the login form and password to the e-mail, designed for one-time password application.
- In this project, I have utilized Python with the Tkinter library to develop an OTP (One-Time Password) authentication application. Tkinter, being a built-in Python library, serves as an excellent choice for creating GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications, offering simplicity and ease of use.
- Libbrary: Tkinter
- Protocol: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
